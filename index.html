            <h1>Luke Kundinger's CS-499 ePortfolio</h1>
        <p>Enhancement One: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%201</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for the first enhancement was a console application created in the course CS-410. It manages a list of clients and their selected financial services of brokerage or retirement. This program allows the user to view and update client information by entering the correct username and password. I chose this artifact because it demonstrates the software development skills of input validation, data structure, and user interface with the menu. The program was improved by adding comments for readability and understanding, expanding input validation, and adding feedback messages to enhance the user experience. The expected course outcomes have been met with these enhancements. There are no updates to my outcome-coverage plans. While enhancing the artifact, I considered the potential user errors to make the user experience better. To resolve the user error issue, I cleared the input and gave feedback to point the user in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Enhancement Two: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%202</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for enhancement two was the course planner program developed in C++. It uses a database of courses and stores them in a hash table. Users can view available courses and search courses with their prerequisites. I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it highlights skills in data structure, dynamic memory allocation, sorting algorithms, and user interface. This artifact was enhanced by adding comments to improve readability, improving memory management, and adding input validation. These enhancements meet the course outcomes that I intended to meet. There are no updates with my outcome-coverage plans. This program helped me learn the importance of memory management when working with pointers. I also learned the importance of handling bad input to create a better experience for the user.</p>
        <p>Enhancement Three: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%203</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for enhancement three was the word frequency program developed in C++. This program uses a text file to count the frequency of each word, allows users to query specific word counts, display all frequencies, and print a histogram. I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my understanding of data structures, input handing, and user experience. I improved this artifact by adding input validation, adding comments for readability, and implementing data saving. This enhancement met my expected course outcomes and there are no updates with my outcome-coverage plans. I learned how to handle file input and the importance of input validation from this program. The challenge I faced when developing this program was handling invalid input to make for a better user experience.</p>
