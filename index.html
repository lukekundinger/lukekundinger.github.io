            <h1>Luke Kundinger's CS-499 ePortfolio</h1>
        <p>Professional Self-Assessment</p>
        <p>Completing the computer science program and building this ePortfolio helped me show my strengths, shape my goals, and get ready for a career in tech. Every course gave me something useful—technical skills, teamwork experience, and a better understanding of how software is built. Putting it all into a portfolio shows how far I have come and what I can offer as a developer.</p>
        <p>I gained solid experience with data structures and algorithms. One key project was a hash table program for storing course data. I built it in C++ and focused on fast lookup and memory efficiency. This helped me understand when and how to use different structures. In software engineering, I followed design steps like planning, testing, and debugging. I worked on a full-stack app using JavaScript and Python, which gave me practice with both front-end and back-end development. Database work was also a big part of the program. I created SQL databases and wrote queries for real-world cases like student records. I learned how to build tables, manage relationships, and protect data. Security was covered in a later course. I practiced input validation and basic encryption to stop attacks like SQL injection. These skills helped me understand how to write safer code.</p> 
        <p>Each artifact in this portfolio shows a different skill—problem-solving, coding, working with data, or building apps. Together, they show the full picture of my abilities in computer science. They also show my progress, from learning the basics to building complete projects. This portfolio is a snapshot of what I have learned and how I can apply it in the real world.</p>

        <p>Enhancement One: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%201</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for the first enhancement was a console application created in the course CS-410. It manages a list of clients and their selected financial services of brokerage or retirement. This program allows the user to view and update client information by entering the correct username and password. I chose this artifact because it demonstrates the software development skills of input validation, data structure, and user interface with the menu. The program was improved by adding comments for readability and understanding, expanding input validation, and adding feedback messages to enhance the user experience. The expected course outcomes have been met with these enhancements. There are no updates to my outcome-coverage plans. While enhancing the artifact, I considered the potential user errors to make the user experience better. To resolve the user error issue, I cleared the input and gave feedback to point the user in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Enhancement Two: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%202</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for enhancement two was the course planner program developed in C++. It uses a database of courses and stores them in a hash table. Users can view available courses and search courses with their prerequisites. I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it highlights skills in data structure, dynamic memory allocation, sorting algorithms, and user interface. This artifact was enhanced by adding comments to improve readability, improving memory management, and adding input validation. These enhancements meet the course outcomes that I intended to meet. There are no updates with my outcome-coverage plans. This program helped me learn the importance of memory management when working with pointers. I also learned the importance of handling bad input to create a better experience for the user.</p>
        <p>Enhancement Three: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%203</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for enhancement three was the word frequency program developed in C++. This program uses a text file to count the frequency of each word, allows users to query specific word counts, display all frequencies, and print a histogram. I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my understanding of data structures, input handing, and user experience. I improved this artifact by adding input validation, adding comments for readability, and implementing data saving. This enhancement met my expected course outcomes and there are no updates with my outcome-coverage plans. I learned how to handle file input and the importance of input validation from this program. The challenge I faced when developing this program was handling invalid input to make for a better user experience.</p>
