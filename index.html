        <p>Enhancement One: https://github.com/lukekundinger/lukekundinger.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%201</p>
        <p>The artifact that I chose for the first enhancement was a console application created in the course CS-410. It manages a list of clients and their selected financial services of brokerage or retirement. This program allows the user to view and update client information by entering the correct username and password. I chose this artifact because it demonstrates the software development skills of input validation, data structure, and user interface with the menu. The program was improved by adding comments for readability and understanding, expanding input validation, and adding feedback messages to enhance the user experience. The expected course outcomes have been met with these enhancements. There are no updates to my outcome-coverage plans. While enhancing the artifact, I considered the potential user errors to make the user experience better. To resolve the user error issue, I cleared the input and gave feedback to point the user in the right direction.<p>
